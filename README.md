# Project Build a Rest API with Spring Boot and MongoDB


Hi everyone.  I hope you're fine. 
My name is Leo. I'm developer and a Software Architech. But also I enjoy learning and teaching.

I develop some projects of my own, but sometimes (many times), I learned from other ones.

I learn from offitial documentation, from Youtbe Channel, from different online education platforms. I like to shared what a leared, give the recognition to the owners.

This project, like others I upload to share knowlege.

This project is based on the video [Spring Boot Tutorial - Build a Rest Api with MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssj0CGxv60k) from the channel [Amigoscode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2KfmYEM4KCuA1ZurravgYw), published on June 1, 2021.

All the links, information about the code, repositorie in the description of the video.

Thank you **Amigoscode** for share your knowlege  üôè  and help me and others in our journey in the software development. 

I learn from this source, it's not exactly the same, but, I think this is the way how you learn. 
 - You see, you listen
 - You repeat... repeat again and again
 - You think in thinks you can change, add, remove.
 - You build things for your own..
 - You share
 - You allways thanks.

Just a little bit of code/cloud :) , but I hope it help you to build something bigger, something better. 
 
Good Loock
